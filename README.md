# Congratulations-Message
The application is a shell script that leverages standard Unix utilities to select top students and email them congratulation messages.
As inputs we had: Student roster: A CSV file of student IDs, UTORids, and email addresses. MarkUs marks format: A CSV file of UTORids and marks (non-negative integers). RO (Registrarâ€™s Office) marks format: A CSV file of student IDs and marks (non-negative integers).
Part A was written in basic sh.
Part B was written in Bash.
